ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sambatipudi1,

Iâ€™m a masterâ€™s student at UMass Amherst determined to become a world-renowned Data Scientist who can change the world someday. The research I am focusing on is based on the adverse effects of social media and how it affects people of different age groups mentally.

Fun, adventurous, and outgoing are some of the words that describe me on a base level. I love exploring new things and learning about the latest trends. I always love to keep myself busy and upskill myself based on the current times. 

I love sports, movies, TV Series, and most of all anime.

Iâ€™m a great team player and I love working with people from all over the world.
